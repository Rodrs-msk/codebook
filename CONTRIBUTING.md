# How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the cBioPortal Codebook! This document provides a brief set of guidelines for contributing.

# Who are you?

We are curious to learn more about you! We would love to help you get started! The contributors in our community all have different backgrounds. For instance some people have:

1. Engineering experience but no to little knowledge of cancer genomics
2. Knowledge about cancer genomics but no to little engineering experience
3. No engineering nor cancer genomics experience but an eagerness to contribute

if you feel like you don't fall into any of these categories, please reach out so you can help us update the above list ðŸ™‚! Note that there are many contributions that can be made to an open source commmunity without coding a single line of code. You can reach us through our [public slack channel](https://slack.cbioportal.org).

# Making a code contribution

The cBioPortal uses a "fork and pull" model for collaborative software development.

From the [GitHub Help Page of Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/):

"The fork & pull model lets anyone fork an existing repository and push changes to their personal fork without requiring access be granted to the source repository. The changes must then be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer. This model reduces the amount of friction for new contributors and is popular with open source projects because it allows people to work independently without upfront coordination."

## Getting Started

 * Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
 * Create an issue in the issues tracker, assuming one does not already exist.
 * Fork the cbioportal codebook on GitHub.  For general instructions on forking a GitHub project, see [Forking a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [Syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).
 
## Contributing Code Changes via a Pull Request

Once you have forked the repo, you need to create your code contributions within a new branch of your forked repo.  For general background on creating and managing branches within GitHub, see:  [Git Branching and Merging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging).

* To begin, create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.

You usually create a branch like so:

```
git checkout master
git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

You then usually commit code changes, and push your branch back to GitHub like so:

```git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]```

A few tips:

* Make commits in logical/cohesive units.

When you are ready to submit your pull-request:

* Push your branch to your GitHub project.
* Open the pull request to the branch you've based your work on

For more details on submitting a pull-request, please see:  [GitHub Guide to Collaborating with issues and pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests).
